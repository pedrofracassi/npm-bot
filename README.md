# npm-bot
This was born as a command for my main bot, [Deku](http://deku.pedrofracassi.me/), but I thought it was a good idea to make a bot only for npm.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pedrofracassi/npm-bot.git
cd npm-bot
npm install
node index.js
```
If you want to daemonize the bot, I recommend [pm2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2).
